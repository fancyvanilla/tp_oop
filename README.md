hey !
This is my first time using github and I thought of importing my uni homework which was a great idea , at least for me . 
In the first tp aka practical work, I built a file handling class that enables you to open a file with a specified mode and do bunch of reading writing and merging . This code is still in progress as I still have some memory errors jumping around every now and then ...
In the second tp which is titled 'produits.cpp', I made a linked list class so I needed 2 classes for that and another one (article class) just because I was told to . 
In the fourth tp , I had to build a filesorter that unsuprisingly takes a file and 2 other parameters and sorts it line by line based a key we have been given (the two parameters : length and position).I used a map as a filesorter because it automatically sorts its elements in increasing order by key so all we had to do is to specfy the key . Lastly , I had added some error handling conotrol statements (like try throw and so on ) and yeah thats all . 

NB: You may have noticed a third tp misssing .Yeah ,I will have to work on it first (a tree class) .Stay tuned for that !
